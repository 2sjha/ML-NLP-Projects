Here's a little morsel of Dunder Mifflin history for you. In a recent interview with IndieWire, Steve Carell shared The Office cast voted on the show’s theme song all those years ago. This detail came up after Carell’s Beautiful Boy co-star Timothée Chalamet told IndieWire that when he marathons The Office, he does "not hit the skip theme song in the beginning, and watch[es] it each time." (Chalamet is, as he’s made abundantly clear during Beautiful Boy’s press tour, a devoted The Office stan.)  
Carell recalled, 
Wait. Does that mean there are three more versions of Jay Ferguson’s theme somewhere out there in the ether? Or was this one of four entirely different compositions that were in the running toward becoming America's Next Top The Office Theme? Either way, cast of one of the greatest scripted comedy shows ever sure did pick a winner of a tune.
In his 2015 memoir The Bassoon King, Rainn Wilson recounted the collaborative effort that went into choosing the mockumentary series' theme song. Per Stereogum, Wilson writes, 
“Mr. Blue Sky” didn’t happen, but it all worked out. Wilson continues,
Did it ever.
The Tale of The Office Theme doesn't stop there. Musician Bob Thiele Jr., AKA Joey Scrantone, chronicles the origin story of the Scrantones and the theme song in his personal blog. In a post that went up back in 2009, he writes,
Thiele Jr. explains he reached out to fellow musicians Dillion O’Brian, Brian Macleod, and Hal Cragin, headed to the studio, and recorded the theme “on a Thursday night, one week before the air-date of the premiere episode.” 
And with that, the song chosen for Dunder Mifflin by Dunder Mifflin was born.
