# Project 2

## Description

This project is based on a synthetically generated by randomly sampling solutions and non-solutions (with solutions having class “1” and non-solutions having class “0”) from a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF). The dataset is randomly generated from five formulas having 500 variables and 300, 500, 1000, 1500 and 1800 clauses (where the length of each clause equals 3) respectively and sampled 100, 1000 and 5000 positive and negative examples from each formula.

The major theme of this project is **hyper-parameter tuning** for a variety of prebuilt [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/s)'s tree classifiers including **Decision Tree Classifier**, **Bagging Classifier**, **Random Forest Classifier** and **Gradient Boosting Classifier**. The performance of each model is tested using the validation dataset and best one is used for the test dataset.

These experiments are also run on the [MNIST dataset](https://www.openml.org/d/554).


## Setup

- Maybe Setup Virtualenv `python -m venv env`
- Install all dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Execution

- If virtual env set up, then `source ./env/bin/activate`
- Run `./run.sh`

Or

- Use the [Jupyter Notebook](./Project2.ipynb) version of this code.
